- Answer
You're describing a highly secure, compartmentalized development and infrastructure setup, centered around:

1. **Qubes OS for secure dev environment**
2. **Handling company secrets (esp. temporary keys)**
3. **Using Keycloak for RBAC and audit trails**
4. **Creating a repeatable lab (on Linux & Windows)**
5. **Managing secure document storage/access**
6. **Self-hosting and integrating Keycloak with your lab**

Let’s break this down step-by-step with guidance for both **hardening Qubes OS** and **building a fast, secure, portable lab environment**.

## 🛡️ 1. Hardening Qubes OS for Development

### ✅ Recommended Qubes Practices:

* **Minimal Templates:** Use minimal Fedora/Debian templates with only necessary packages.
* **Separate Qubes:**

  * `dev-qube` for coding
  * `vault` for secrets (no network)
  * `build` for compiling
  * `net` & `firewall` for network control
  * `keycloak-admin` for managing identity infra
* **USB qubes**: Isolate USB devices. Never attach USB directly to dom0.

### 🔐 Secrets Management

* Store secrets in `vault` or a `vault+gpg` combo (gpg-agent qube).
* Access via **Qubes RPC** or inter-qube file exchange (qvm-copy/qvm-run).
* Use temporary in-memory decryption, e.g., decrypt key, mount disk, destroy mount after use.

---

## 📦 2. Handling System Storage with Secrets (Key-Based Access)

### Use Case:

* You temporarily mount encrypted volumes based on **role-based access** verified by Keycloak.
* Secrets are decrypted only in isolated qubes based on access granted.

### 🔧 Implementation Steps:

1. **Disk Encryption with LUKS + Clevis**

   * Bind key unlock to Keycloak/JWT token using `clevis` and `tang` or custom `jwt` pin.
   * Use `udisksctl` or `cryptsetup` with scripted logic inside a secure qube.

2. **Access Control via Keycloak:**

   * User requests a role (e.g. "developer-disk-access").
   * Keycloak grants a short-lived JWT.
   * Vault qube verifies JWT, unlocks disk temporarily, sends mount info to build qube.
   * Audit logs stored.

3. **Storage Security Considerations:**

   * Disk data is encrypted at rest (LUKS2).
   * Keys live only in RAM.
   * Qubes Firewall and Qrexec policies block unauthorized access.

## 🔐 3. Deploying Keycloak On-Prem (Self-hosted)

### ✳️ Keycloak Core Deployment (on Home Server / Lab)

#### Pre-reqs:

* **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 / Debian 12 / Rocky Linux
* **Keycloak Version:** Use latest stable (24+)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (hosted or containerized)
* **TLS:** Use Caddy/Nginx with Let's Encrypt (even for local, if possible)

#### Option A: Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  keycloak:
    image: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:latest
    command: start-dev
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      KEYCLOAK_ADMIN: admin
      KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD: change_this
    volumes:
      - keycloak_data:/opt/keycloak/data
volumes:
  keycloak_data:
```

#### Option B: Podman + systemd (for prod-like setup)

Install:

```bash
sudo apt install podman
```

Generate service:

```bash
podman generate systemd --name keycloak > ~/.config/systemd/user/keycloak.service
systemctl --user daemon-reexec
systemctl --user start keycloak
```

---

## 🔄 4. Automating Lab Environment Setup (Linux & Windows)

### For Linux:

Use **Ansible** with a combination of:

* `virt-install` or `libvirt` to spin VMs
* Qubes RPC & SaltStack for inter-qube automation
* Store VM definitions as Git-based templates

Example:

```bash
ansible-playbook setup-lab.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini
```

Ansible Roles:

* `keycloak-deploy`
* `encrypted-storage-setup`
* `audit-log-forwarding`

### For Windows:

Use **Hyper-V** or **WSL2 + Docker Desktop** with pre-built images.

* Automate via PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest https://... -OutFile keycloak.zip
Expand-Archive keycloak.zip -DestinationPath C:\Keycloak
```

* Or use Chocolatey:

```powershell
choco install keycloak -y
```

#### Recommended Tooling:

* Use Vagrant with Libvirt (Linux) / VirtualBox (Windows)
* Provide YAML specs for each environment (similar to Docker Compose)

---

## 📄 5. Managing Secure Documents

### Tools:

* **Cryptomator**: Encrypted cloud/local storage
* **git-crypt** or **SOPS**: For Git-based secure document management
* **Tresorit / Nextcloud**: For user-friendly document sync

Use `vault` qube to decrypt/sign/encrypt any documents before moving them.

---

## 🧩 6. Keycloak Integration with Qubes & LAB Resources

### Use Keycloak for:

* Identity Provider (IdP) with OpenID Connect
* Role-based access for resources
* Token issuing for temporary access

### Resources it can guard:

* Git repos (via Gitea + OAuth)
* Dev servers
* Secrets stores (HashiCorp Vault, or custom GPG vault)
* Encrypted disks
* Web apps / UIs

# Same question another answer
To use and harden Qubes OS for development, especially when working with sensitive company secrets (including encryption keys) in system storage, here are some recommended approaches and best practices:

### How to Use and Harden Qubes OS for Development

1. **Leverage Qubes VM Isolation:**
   - Use different AppVMs (work domains) for different purposes, e.g., development, browsing, and sensitive data handling, to isolate workflows.
   - Use disposable VMs (Disposables or sys-dvm) for temporary tasks or unknown files to reduce malware persistence risk.
   - Run system components like network and USB on separate sys-net and sys-usb VMs.

2. **Harden VM Boot and Filesystem:**
   - Use tools like the Qubes-VM-hardening project that protect VM startup by locking down and quarantining the private volumes (/rw directories) to prevent malware embedding at startup.
   - Use whitelisting and SHA256 hash verification of executables and scripts in your VMs to detect unauthorized changes.
   - Consider using template-based AppVMs for easier management and quicker recovery.

3. **Secure Storage Handling for Company Secrets:**
   - Use encrypted storage (LUKS/dm-crypt) at the disk or partition level for persistent VM storage and for external drives holding sensitive data.
   - Consider dedicating a Storage Qube - a dedicated VM managing encrypted storage volumes that can be accessed by authorized VMs via secure protocols like NFS or SSHFS, enforcing strict IP and VM permission controls.
   - In Qubes, encrypt and mount storage volumes only in trusted VMs and avoid widespread access.
   - Use ephemeral VMs with ephemeral storage for temporary work with keys or sensitive documents, minimizing residual data on disk.
   - You can also consider solutions like verifiable mounts, split-dm-crypt, etc., for advanced encryption schemes.

4. **Access Management and Integration:**
   - Integrate identity and access management tools (e.g., Keycloak running in Azure) with your environment. Use strong authentication and authorization when accessing resources inside Qubes.
   - Manage secrets with dedicated password storage or secret management tools in isolated VMs.
   - Use Qubes RPC policies and firewall rules to strictly control inter-VM communication and resource access.

### Creating Such a Secure Environment Fast on Any System (Linux and Windows Steps)

#### On Linux:

- Install Qubes OS on a fast SSD for better performance.
- Set up encrypted partitions via LUKS for storage.
- Create VMs using Qubes Manager or CLI, separating workloads.
- Configure storage VM(s) with encrypted volumes dedicated for company secrets.
- Mount and share encrypted volumes to AppVMs via NFS or SSHFS with strict permission control.
- Use scripts or Ansible for automation of creating VMs and setting up policies.
- Integrate Keycloak by using web authentication in the relevant VMs or via VPN connections.

#### On Windows:

- Native Qubes OS installation is not supported on Windows; however:
   - Use a hypervisor like VMware Workstation or VirtualBox to run Qubes OS or a Linux VM.
   - Use VeraCrypt for encrypted storage volumes to hold sensitive company secrets.
   - Map/encrypt volumes and share over the network with secure protocols (SMB with encryption, SSHFS via Windows Subsystem for Linux - WSL).
   - Access Qubes or Linux VM storage using secure tunnels authenticated by Keycloak.
   - Automate mounting and access control using scripts or PowerShell.

***

### Summary

To **harden Qubes OS for development** handling company secrets, focus on:

- Strong VM isolation and use of disposable VMs.
- Encrypted storage volumes managed by dedicated Storage Qubes.
- Lockdown techniques like VM boot protection and whitelisting.
- Strict access control with RPC policies and network isolation.
- Integration with identity/access management (Keycloak) for resource authentication.

For **fast environment creation**, automate VM and storage configuration on Linux using Qubes tools and scripts, while on Windows, rely on virtualization and encrypted containers like VeraCrypt with integration through secure network access.

This approach balances usability, security, and agility in handling critical secrets and working with temporary disks in Qubes deployments or a hybrid Linux-Windows ecosystem.
